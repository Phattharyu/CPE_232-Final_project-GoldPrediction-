# CPE 232 Final project-Gold Prediction
Gold, often viewed as a safe-haven investment during times of economic instability, is 
subject to fluctuations influenced by various economic indicators, including inflation, GDP, 
and geopolitical risks. Accurately forecasting gold prices is of significant interest to investors 
looking to hedge against market downturns or capitalize on favorable price movements. This 
project aims to predict gold prices using machine learning models, incorporating historical 
data on gold prices and macroeconomic variables such as CPI (Consumer Price Index), GDP 
(Gross Domestic Product), and unemployment rates. Several models, including Random 
Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM), were 
applied to predict gold prices for the next day based on historical data. The CNN model 
outperformed other models, achieving an MAPE score of 0.00515 and an RMSE of 
0.0050285 on the test set, indicating its ability to accurately predict gold prices by using Price 
and Technical Indicators features. The findings suggest that deep learning models, 
particularly ensemble methods like CNN, are effective for predicting gold prices and can 
offer valuable insights for investors in financial markets.
