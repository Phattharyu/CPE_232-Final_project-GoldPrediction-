# CPE_232-Final_project-GoldPrediction-
## Introduction
To begin with, the economy of the world has begun to slowly recess and affect the gold price to rise to a new high of around 3000 USD/oz. A large amount of money comes to the gold market as the Value Keeper since the investors are afraid to invest in the stock market. Historically, gold prices have been influenced by economic recessions, inflation rates, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical instability, making accurate price prediction a crucial tool for investors, policymakers, and financial institutions.
After reviewing the methodology for predicting the Gold price, the majority of data scientists tend to focus on optimizing the model or creating a well-architected neural network model. However, fewer cases use indicators that most technical traders apply to understand the trend and improve their trading strategy as features to improve the model accuracy. Additionally, some features might be taken into consideration like the unemployment rate, CPI, or GDP since these features are often closely linked to investor sentiment and market stability.
To conclude, our group decided to apply these indicators and additional features, find out the aspects of why most Kagglers did not use indicators as features, and explore many kinds of models to train the data.
## Objective
